    <h1>School Term Date Calculator</h1>
    <p>So I know that probably a bazillion of these exist online, but I can't be bothered to find them, but I can be bothered to spend 10 minutes proompting ChatGPT to make a quick website to calculate them from me. For some reason, it's just a day ahead???? So I unfortunately had to do some thinking and edit the javascript :(</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, enjoy I guess :)</p>
    <p>And yes, ChatGPT made almost the entirety of this, except for obviously these paragraphs of text and the very small changes I made to its js. Yes, that does mean it made this CSS! Which I have to admit is better made than my CSS :|</p>
    <label for="startDate">Enter Start Date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="startDate">
    <br>
    <label for="week">Select Week:</label>
    <input type="number" id="week" min="1" placeholder="Week">
    <label for="day">Select Day:</label>
    <select id="day">
      <option value="monday">Monday</option>
      <option value="tuesday">Tuesday</option>
      <option value="wednesday">Wednesday</option>
      <option value="thursday">Thursday</option>
      <option value="friday">Friday</option>
    </select>
    <br>
    <button onclick="calculateDate()">Calculate Date</button>
    <p id="result"></p>
